## 🚀 Quick Reference: Key Concepts

### ConfigService Singleton Pattern
```typescript
import { getConfig } from '@/config';

const config = getConfig();
const emulators = config.getEmulatorConfig();

if (emulators) {
  connectFirestoreEmulator(db, emulators.firestore.host, emulators.firestore.port);
}
```
**Eliminates:** Hardcoded Firebase emulator ports
**See:** FIREBASE-NEXTJS-SETUP-GUIDE.md (ConfigService Pattern) + REUSABLE-PATTERNS.md (Pattern 1)

### Automated Setup Script
```bash
npm run setup  # <5 minutes to fully configured environment
```
**Replaces:** 2-4 hours of manual setup
**See:** FIREBASE-NEXTJS-SETUP-GUIDE.md (Development Workflow) + REUSABLE-PATTERNS.md (Pattern 4)

### E2E Emulator Workflow
```bash
npm run e2e:start   # Start emulators, wait for ready
npm run test:e2e    # Run tests
npm run e2e:stop    # Clean shutdown
```
**Eliminates:** Manual emulator management, "forgot to start emulators" errors
**See:** FIREBASE-NEXTJS-SETUP-GUIDE.md (Testing Strategies) + REUSABLE-PATTERNS.md (Pattern 6)

### Workspace Package Bundling (CI)
```yaml
# Bundle workspace packages for CI
- run: |
    npm run build --workspace=packages/shared-types
    cd packages/shared-types && npm pack
    cd ../../apps/functions
    npm install ../../packages/shared-types/*.tgz
```
**Fixes:** "Cannot find module 'shared-types'" in CI
**See:** PITFALLS-AND-SOLUTIONS.md (Pitfall 7) + REUSABLE-PATTERNS.md (Pattern 5)

## 💡 Key Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. ✅ **Incremental 3-phase approach** - Delivered value after each phase
2. ✅ **Singleton pattern for ConfigService** - Single source of truth
3. ✅ **Comprehensive story specifications** - Faster implementation
4. ✅ **Automated validation scripts** - Caught errors early
5. ✅ **BMad methodology with AI agents** - 4 days vs 2-3 weeks

### What to Improve
1. ⚠️ **Earlier CI testing** - Test workspace packages in CI early
2. ⚠️ **Upfront CI/CD planning** - Research monorepo CI patterns first
3. ⚠️ **Document decisions when made** - Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
